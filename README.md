# Software Engineer Wrap 2025

A Spotify Wrapped‑style “year in code” card generator for developers. It runs 100% in your browser—no backend, no uploads, just your data on your device.

Live demo: https://jagan-jijo.github.io/softdev-wrapped/

## What it does

- Build a tall 9:16 story card with your yearly stats
- Live preview while you edit
- Export a crisp PNG for sharing
- Themes (2 dark + 2 light)
- Custom badges + apps + languages
- Local storage saves everything automatically

## Notes

- Everything is client-side; nothing is uploaded.
- Works offline once loaded.

Have fun with it.
