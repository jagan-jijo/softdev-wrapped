# Software Engineer Wrap 2025

A Spotify Wrapped‑style “year in code” card generator for developers. It runs 100% in your browser—no backend, no uploads, just your data on your device.

Live demo: https://jagan-jijo.github.io/softdev-wrapped/

## What it does

- Build a tall 9:16 story card with your yearly stats
- Live preview while you edit
- Export a crisp PNG for sharing
- Themes (2 dark + 2 light)
- Custom badges + apps + languages
- Local storage saves everything automatically

## Run it locally

- Open `index.html` in a browser, or
- Serve the folder with any static server (optional)

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)

1. Push the repo to GitHub.
2. Go to Settings -> Pages.
3. Set the source to `main` and `/ (root)`.
4. Save and open your Pages URL.

## Notes

- Everything is client-side; nothing is uploaded.
- Works offline once loaded.

Have fun with it.
